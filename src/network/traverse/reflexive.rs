//! Reflexive (public) address discovery — the peer-echoed STUN primitive.
//!
//! A node cannot see its own public address directly: NAT rewrites the source of every outbound datagram.
//! It learns that address by asking another node "what source did you see me at?" — and that answer, echoed on the *same UDP socket the data flows over*, is the correct reflexive address (unlike fgtw.org's `cf-connecting-ip`, which reflects the TLS flow and is thus only right for cone NATs).
//!
//! Two channels feed this: a friend's signed pong (`observed_addr`, trusted — the pong is contact-gated, so it comes from someone in our fleet/contacts) and an open `ReflectResponse` from any directory-serving node (untrusted — corroborated by quorum before adoption, so a single lying peer can't poison the address we then publish). See the traversal plan, P0.
